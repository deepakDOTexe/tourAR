# tourAR
This Android App shows all the nearby places present around along with their realtime distance from the phone on the App itself when camera pointed in that direction.

This App works on  Augmented Reality built using Google's ARcore released in 2018 .
It was built during Prototype 2.0 , IIIT Allahabad

I like this one
